# Dart Scorer

A simple web application to manually track scores for different dart games.

## Features
- Choose between **501**, **301**, or **Around the Clock**.
- Enter each dart's value using traditional multiplier/value selectors.
- Reset the game at any time.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser. Select a game and click **Start Game**.
For each turn choose the multiplier (S/D/T) and the value hit for all three darts
then press **Submit**. The display updates your remaining points (501/301) or
the next target number (Around the Clock). When the game finishes, a message is
shown. Use **Reset** to start over.
